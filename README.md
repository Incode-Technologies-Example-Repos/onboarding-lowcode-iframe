# Sample Iframe App
This app showcase how to create a low code app that will fetch the
url of the onboarding, load it in an iframe and wait for it to finish
before fetching the score.

    activate m
    m-->>b: Get Onboarding URL
    note over b: runs /omni/start,<br>/omni/onboarding-url
    b-->>m: {url, interviewId}

# Backend Server
A backend server that will generate the url is needed for this sample,
luckily for you we already have sample server for PHP, NodeJS, Python,
PHP and Java and .NET, please reffer to our documentation on subject:
[Quick Start Sample Server](https://developer.incode.com/docs/quick-start-servers)

In order to simplfy development, this repo is configured to reverse
proxy a local backend server (`http://localhost:3000`) in the `/api`
url like `https://<your-ip>:5173/api`, if you want to point your
frontend development to a backend server deployed elsewhere, change
the VITE_TOKEN_SERVER_URL to the full url of such server.

# Install
First install all the required packages
```
npm install
```

# Configure
Copy `.env.example` as `.env` and configure it to point to a remote
server, or leave it as /api to point to the reverse proxied server
running in your local machine

```
VITE_TOKEN_SERVER_URL=/api
```

# Development
This repo is configured so run it in development by executing
```
npm run dev
```

You will get a hot reloading environment that exposes the page in
localhost and in the ip of the machine in case you want to try it
in your cellphone.

# Polling Schema
For a proper execution of this project, it is necessary to define
the ADMIN_TOKEN in the .env files of your backend project.

The admin token will be used during the /onboarding-status endpoint call 
to check whether a session is finished or not and consequently fetch its score.
